	[x] Nav component that lets you go backwards - may require a controller that keeps track of all user data so that user can be routed correctly

	[x] Creating a Todolist and todolistitem straight from the URL does NOT work yet (it will create a todolist but it does NOT save for the user)
		[x] Make sure you can do all of these things:
			[x] create user from website AND Url
			[x] create todolist from website AND Url
				[x] The created todolist will be associated with the user it is a part of
			[x] create todo from website AND Url
				[x] Creating a todo from the URL will edit and update the todolist it is a part of.
			[x] create a user, and todolist, and a todoitem all in one go, ie (s2doo.me/<newUser>/<newTodolist>/<newTodo>), and have everything be created successfully.
			[x] create a user and a todolist in one go

	[x] Allow spaces in Todolist titles, todo titles, todo descriptions, but NOT usernames

					[] Creating a Todolist and todolistitem straight from the URL does NOT work yet (it will create a todolist but it does NOT save for the user)
						[] Make sure you can do all of these things:
							[] create user from website AND Url
							[] create todolist from website AND Url

							[x] create a user and a todolist in one go
	[x] username and todolist title Validation ?
		[x] Do not allow users to enter certain characters or numbers
	[] Break form submit button and input tags into seperate components/directives (since they are all designed and built so similarly, just need to pass in the proper form id)
	[] Add Todolist features
		[] Location
		[] Lists inside of Todolists (kind of like collections of todos within todolists that you can still checkOff one at a time)
	[] Optimize the website
		[] Cache images and JS scipts and pages
		[] Utilize Local Storage over Cookies to reduce bandwidth of HTTP requests
		[] minify and uglify JS code
		[] use gulp or webpack to minify files and build everything out
	[] Add modal if username exists ("This name exists. Do you want to see this users todolists or do you want to create a new one?")
	[] Use a gulp task runner to minify/uglify site

	[] URLs ending in '/' will create blank users and blank todolists
	[] No Validation on URL creation (In other words, I can create titles and users with too few characters and special characters from the URL)
	[] Todo List Titles cannot have spaces in them (They should be able to have spaces!)
	[x] Creating a Todolist and todolistitem straight from the URL does NOT work yet (Although you can access existing todolists this way just fine)
	[] Creating a user from the create-user component on home page will overwrite an existing user
		[***] modal if username exists ("This name exists. Do you want to see this users todolists or do you want to create a new one?")
	[x] Editing Todolist Titles not working properly as cancelling will still update the current title (although it will not save which is good)
	[] When we delete a todolist, it is not removing that todolist._id from the users "todolists" array. So a user may have an array with like 20 todolists but only have 3 todolists showing, and that is because he has deleted 17 of them. (try console logging "console.log(this.currentUser.todolists)" in the todolists.component.js $onInit method).
		** This is low priority, there is no consequence of this, but it would be cleaner to do so i think... ALTHOUGH, Maybe we should keep these Ids incase user wants to bring back deleted list? nah, deelete them from array!
