	[] Creating a Todolist and todolistitem straight from the URL does NOT work yet (it will create a todolist but it does NOT save for the user)
		[] Make sure you can do all of these things:
			[] create user from website AND Url
			[] create todolist from website AND Url
				[] The created todolist will be associated with the user it is a part of
			[] create todo from websie AND Url
				[] Creating a todo from the URL will edit and update the todolist it is a part of.
			[] create a user, and todolist, and a todoitem all in one go, ie (s2doo.me/<newUser>/<newTodolist>/<newTodo>), and have everything be created successfully.
			[] create a user and a todolist in one go

	[] Add modal if username exists ("This name exists. Do you want to see this users todolists or do you want to create a new one?")
	[] Use a gulp task runner to minify/uglify site

	[] URLs ending in '/' will create blank users and blank todolists
	[] Todo List Titles cannot have spaces in them (They should be able to have spaces!)
	[] Creating a Todolist and todolistitem straight from the URL does NOT work yet (Although you can access existing todolists this way just fine)
	[] Creating a user from the create-user component on home page will overwrite an existing user
		[***] modal if username exists ("This name exists. Do you want to see this users todolists or do you want to create a new one?")
	[] Editing Todolist Titles not working properly as cancelling will still update the current title (although it will not save which is good)
